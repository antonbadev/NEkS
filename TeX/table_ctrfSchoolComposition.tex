    \fignotetitle{Note:} \fignotetext{A cap of $x\%$ same-race students is implemented with a swap of $(100-x)\%$ students. 
    The last column shows the predicted changes in overall smoking under different same-race caps. 
    The policy induces statistically significant changes in the overall smoking as suggested by 
    the statistical tests in appendix D.}
