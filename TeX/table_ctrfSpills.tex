    \fignotetitle{Note:} The first column lists the alternative attendance rates. The second and third columns display the smoking rate and the change in smoking rate respectively if the decrease would be proportional to the intervention, i.e. computes a baseline without peer effects. The last column computes the ratio between the percentage change in the number of smokers and the attendance rate. Note that that attendance is random with respect to the smoking status of the students. If the campaign is able to target only students who are currently smokers, the spillover effects will be even larger.
