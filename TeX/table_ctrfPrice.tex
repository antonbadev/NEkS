    \fignotetitle{Note:} The first column shows proposed increases in tobacco prices in cents. 
    The average price of a pack of cigarettes is \$1.67 so that 20 cents is approximately 10\%. 
    The second through fourth columns show the predicted increase in the overall smoking (baseline 41\%) in ppt 
    from the full model, from the model when the friendship network is fixed, and 
    from the model when no social network data is available. 
    In this last scenario the local peer effect term is absent so that $\phi$ is forced to equal zero in the estimation.
